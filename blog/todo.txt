Bias in Data


Vanishing/Exploding Gradients: You mention that Layer Normalization helps gradients flow, but from a technical POV, it would be useful to explain why gradients tend to disappear or explode in deep networks without these techniques.


Inference vs. Training: You mention training processes, but you don't explicitly distinguish the technical difference in how the model operates during Inference (generating text) versus Training (updating weights).


Overfitting and Regularization: From a technical POV, a model can "cheat" by memorizing your training data rather than learning patterns. Concepts like Dropout or Weight Decay (which prevent this) are standard technical components missing here.

5. Evaluating Success: Beyond "Loss"
You explain how a model learns (Optimizer/Loss), but not how a human knows if the model is actually "good."
    What's missing: A section on Benchmarks (like MMLU or HumanEval) and the concept of Perplexity. How do we measure if one version of ChatGPT is better than the last?



Add a "Tiny-Implementation": A few lines of code or a logic flow for a minimal system.


Address Hardware/Scaling: Explain that "Intelligence" in these systems is often a result of scaling these simple concepts across billions of parameters and thousands of GPUs.
