Bias in Data


Vanishing/Exploding Gradients: You mention that Layer Normalization helps gradients flow, but from a technical POV, it would be useful to explain why gradients tend to disappear or explode in deep networks without these techniques.


Inference vs. Training: You mention training processes, but you don't explicitly distinguish the technical difference in how the model operates during Inference (generating text) versus Training (updating weights).


Overfitting and Regularization: From a technical POV, a model can "cheat" by memorizing your training data rather than learning patterns. Concepts like Dropout or Weight Decay (which prevent this) are standard technical components missing here.



RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback),


5. Evaluating Success: Beyond "Loss"
You explain how a model learns (Optimizer/Loss), but not how a human knows if the model is actually "good."
    What's missing: A section on Benchmarks (like MMLU or HumanEval) and the concept of Perplexity. How do we measure if one version of ChatGPT is better than the last?



Add a "Tiny-Implementation": A few lines of code or a logic flow for a minimal system.


Address Hardware/Scaling: Explain that "Intelligence" in these systems is often a result of scaling these simple concepts across billions of parameters and thousands of GPUs.



1. The "Mathematical Bridge" (Linear Algebra)
You have "1+1=2" and "Derivatives," but you are missing the middle step: Matrices.
    The Gap: You mention vectors in your embedding section, but you haven't explained that a Transformer is essentially just a series of massive matrix multiplications (W⋅x+b).
    Why it's needed: A beginner won't understand how a "Minimal Neuron" scales up to a "Transformer" without understanding that we don't calculate one neuron at a time; we calculate thousands at once using grids of numbers.
    Missing Concept: Matrix Multiplication as "Parallel Processing."



2. The "Hello World" of Implementation (The Simplest System)
Your goal is to help people "implement very simple systems from scratch." Even with all your topics, a reader might still not know where to write the first line of code.
    The Gap: You need a Concrete Project.
    The Solution: Add a section on building a Perceptron for a Logic Gate (like an OR gate or AND gate).
    Why it's needed: This is the smallest "complete" system. It uses an input, a weight, a bias, an activation function, and a loss. It proves the math works in less than 10 lines of code.


3. The "Token Lifecycle" (Connecting the Modules)
You have sections on Tokenizers, Embeddings, Attention, and Softmax. However, these are currently "islands" of knowledge.
    The Gap: You need a Data Flow Narrative.
    The Solution: A chapter called "The Life of a Prompt." Trace the word "Hello" through every single component you've written about.
        Step 1: Tokenizer turns it into ID 15496.
        Step 2: Embedding turns it into a vector.
        Step 3: Attention looks at the words around it.
        Step 4: Softmax predicts the next word "world."
    Why it's needed: This turns a list of definitions into a functional machine in the reader's mind.


5. Evaluating "Truth"
You have "Hallucinations" in your text, but you don't explain how we measure if an AI is "smart."
    The Gap: Loss vs. Metrics. * The Solution: Explain that while a model minimizes "Loss" during training, humans measure "Accuracy" or "Perplexity."
    Why it's needed: It helps the reader understand that a model can have a very low "Loss" but still be a "Stochastic Parrot" that doesn't actually understand the logic.
