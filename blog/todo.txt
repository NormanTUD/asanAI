"If A and B have almost identical environments we say that they are synonyms"

bei embeddings:
- interaktiv eigene 1, 2d und 3d embeddings erstellen lassen, als vektoren definieren und dann rechnen lassen und mit den vorherigen tools anzeigen
 - alle embeddings interaktiv in einer tabelle zeigen

Vanishing/Exploding Gradients: You mention that Layer Normalization helps gradients flow, but from a technical POV, it would be useful to explain why gradients tend to disappear or explode in deep networks without these techniques.


Inference vs. Training: You mention training processes, but you don't explicitly distinguish the technical difference in how the model operates during Inference (generating text) versus Training (updating weights).


Overfitting and Regularization: From a technical POV, a model can "cheat" by memorizing your training data rather than learning patterns. Concepts like Dropout or Weight Decay (which prevent this) are standard technical components missing here.
