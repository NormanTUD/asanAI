# Contributing to asanAI

Welcome!  
If you're here, you already belong. 👋  
asanAI is a no-code browser ML toolkit powered by TensorFlow.js — built to help people **learn ML and understand how it works**, not just click buttons and pray.

This project grows when people poke it, improve it, and occasionally tell it it’s wrong (politely-ish).

---

## 🚀 What We Accept

Everything that makes the project better:

- Code (JS / HTML / PHP — browser-first, TFJS backend)
- Documentation
- Bug fixes
- Feature improvements
- UI/UX tweaks
- Plugins & extensions
- Model training contributions
- Dataset submissions
- Tests
- Performance improvements
- Typos. Yes, those too.

If you’re unsure whether something is welcome, assume **yes**.

---

## 🧠 Principles

- **Everything runs in the browser**
- **User data must never leave the browser**
- **MIT-compatible only**
- Keep things light. No heavy frameworks.
- No sneaky telemetry, analytics or “just a small cloud call”
- Respect the user. Respect reality. Respect each other.
- Curiosity > ego. Calm > drama.

---

## 🛠️ Development Setup

Requirements:

- Git
- Linux/Docker

Install deps, run dev server, usual jazz.

If you can’t run it? Open an issue. If you break it? Congrats, you're now a contributor — please submit a patch. 😄

---

## ✅ Contribution Workflow

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch (`feature/my-cool-thing`)
3. Make changes
4. Keep PRs reasonably small if possible
5. Run tests
6. Open PR

We love atomic PRs, but if you show up with a mega-PR that slaps — we’re not mad.

---

## 🧪 Tests

All tests must pass.

If you add a feature, adding tests is strongly encouraged.  
If you break a test, fix it or bring chocolate. Chocolate is cheaper.

---

## 🧹 Style & Code Quality

- Clean, readable code
- Small modules > giant files
- Avoid bloat
- Prefer clarity over being “clever”
- No heavy frameworks — browser first, lightweight always
- If adding deps, ask:  
  *“Will future humans curse my name?”*

Linting/format rules live in the repo. Follow them. Or auto-format and pretend you did.

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **User data never leaves the browser**
- No remote calls unless explicitly documented and user-approved
- No tracking, telemetry, mystery sync, or magic crypto mining “features”

---

## 🤝 Collaboration Style

- Be helpful
- Be patient
- Be curious
- Assume good intent
- Avoid drama
- If someone is wrong, help them be less wrong — kindly

If needed: disagree like an adult, not a Twitter thread.

---

## 🌍 Community

We welcome:

- Beginners  
- Researchers  
- Tinkerers  
- Teachers  
- People who just like pressing buttons and seeing colors

If you want to learn, teach, experiment, fix something, or poke fun — you're in.

---

## ✨ Vision

> **asanAI exists to help people learn ML and understand how ML models work.**

Not to gatekeep it.  
Not to hide it behind magic.  
To make it accessible, transparent, and fun.

---

## 🧊 What we avoid

- Heavy frameworks
- Telemetry / phoning home / sneaky cloud stuff
- Bloat
- Drama
- Over-engineering for the sake of showing off

Minimalism with power — that’s the sweet spot.

---

## 📬 Need Something?

Open an issue. Start a discussion. Bring memes.  
We like memes.

If you’re stuck or unsure, just ask.  
If you broke something… congrats, you’re part of the team already 😉
